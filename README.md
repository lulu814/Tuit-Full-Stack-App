# Tuit-Full-Stack-App
CS5500 Final Project

This is the main repo. Since most of time we will just commit/merge to the separate frontend and backend repos, we do not need to keep this repo updated.


Explicitly tell Git to download the contents of submodules:

git submodule update --init --recursive
