# Feature
## Bookmark Feature
For the bookmark feature, users can bookmark tuits by clicking the bookmark icon and can check them in the bookmark page later. Users can also unbookmark the tuit by clicking the same tuit's bookmark icon a second time, and it will also be removed from the userâ€™s bookmark page. 

This feature is very helpful as users can save any interesting tuits as they are exploring the tuit website and can check them later in one place. If they think some tuits are not interesting later on, or if they misclick the bookmark button, they can unbookmark them anytime, which is very convenient.
## Media Assets Uploading and Management
For uploading and managing media assets, we are planning to implement a tuit interface where users can post any type of content, including text, pictures, videos, and other media assets. We will also have another interface where we can manage these uploaded media assets, and users can view all the tuits, delete any of the media assets, etc.

This feature is very helpful as users can upload any type of media assets to their tuits, in addition to texts. Nowadays, people are increasingly intrigued by visualized social media, such as pictures, short videos, and streaming services. So with the functionality of uploading different types of media assets, our product would be more competitive in the market.
## Administration Panel
For the administration panel, we are planning to implement a page where the user can manage all the user accounts in the database after the user logs in as an admin role. The admin should be able to create a user account, view all existing users as a list, update a user account, and delete a user account.

This feature is very helpful as we need an admin role to manage all users in the database and providing a centralized administration panel would be very convenient for the admin to monitor the tuit product.
